<p>I had a conflict with my roommate’s girlfriend. She had moved in from another state and was staying at our apartment until she found a job and could get her own place. I was totally okay with that because everyone needs a little help when they’re first starting out. The conflict started when we all noticed how messy she was. She was the messiest out of all of us, never cleaned up after herself and never did anything to help. I didn’t want to tell her what to do, but sometimes I would ask her to put away her dish or wash the pan she used. It kinda took her a while to get around to it, but she eventually did it. I did end up cleaning up after her, but not because I was trying to set an example, but because I was annoyed by the mess and didn’t want to wait for her to clean it up. Eventually I stopped asking her because it took less time for me to do it myself. Upon analyzing the conflict, I realized that I was upset because I felt like she was disrespecting our shared space and she wasn’t doing her part like everyone else. I was also upset because it made me feel like it was my responsibility to not only ask her to help but also to clean up anyways. To resolve the conflict, we had an “apartment meeting” to discuss communal chores and whatnot. If I could go back, I would have had the apartment meeting a lot sooner. Because of this experience, I learned that it’s not my sole responsibility to solve a conflict; it’s not my job to nag or take care of everything. It was better to work together, than for me to try and fix the conflict by myself. </p>
