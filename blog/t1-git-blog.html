      Lesson learned: I don’t recommend trying to quickly learn everything last minute. It takes time to fully comprehend even basic concepts within programming to be able to regurgitate it to someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
        This week I learned a bit about the command line and have gotten more familiar with Git and GitHub.

     Whenever I’m flying and am stuck in a middle seat because I procrastinated booking my ticket yet again, I try to make small talk to the person next to me in the aisle seat to gauge how annoyed they will be when I ask to go to the bathroom 2 - 3 times during the flight (not sure how effective this strategy is). If ever I am seated next to another beginner web developer I will now be able to win them over by being able to answer ALL of their questions, as long as they are limited to:

      What is version control?<br>
Version control keeps track of the changes you make to a file. It tracks all of the changes you’ve made and when you make them.
    </p>
      <p>
      What are the benefits of version control?<br>
Version control allows you to go back in time at any point in your code. If something in your code is wrong, you can simply go back to an earlier version that doesn’t have any errors and work from there. <br>
But version control is most beneficial when you are working on the same project with other people. At my last job, we had to email each other the same file back and forth until we were done. Not only was this disorganized and ineffective, but this practice was also really annoying. Sometimes I would be working on an outdated file or I would overwrite on or accidently delete someone else’s changes. Version control eliminates all of this hassle. Version control allows many people to work on the same files at the same time. It can combine changes from multiple people into a complete file.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?
      <br>
      Git uses version control to keep track of changes. It allows you to edit and work on an existing code file without actually changing the code until you are sure you want to make the changes. This prevents you from messing up code that you know already works. Git views your code files like a “tree.” You can create a “branch” off that “tree” to work on your code without changing the “trunk” of tree until you’re ready.

    <p>Why use GitHub to store your code?  <br>
There are three main reasons to use GitHub to store your code. The first is obviously version control. Secondly, because GitHub lives remotely on the Internet, you will be able to access your code from any computer. Lastly, GitHub is PERFECT for collaborating with others. Because GitHub stores open-source code, other people can edit, improve and diversify your code,
