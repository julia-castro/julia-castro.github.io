  <section>
   <p>In Ruby, classes organize and produce objects with similar methods and attributes.</p>

   <p>Class Syntax:</br>
    class ClassName</br>
      #do something</br>
    end</p>

  <p>Class names have to start with an uppercase leter and use CamelCase instead of snake_case. In the example above, ClassName is now a class.</p>

  <p>Within your classes, you will want to create a method called initialize. Initialize takes as many arguments as you want.</p>

  <p>You then use the @ operator before a variable to show that it is an instance variable, meaning it is attached to the instance of the class.</p>

  <p>class HarryPotterCharacters</br>
    def initialize(first_name,last_name)</br>
      @first_name = first_name</br>
      @last_name = last_name</br>
    end</br>
  end</p>

  <p>Names = HarryPotterCharacters.new("Ron","Weasley")</p>

  <p>In this example, I created an instance Names of the class HarryPotterCharacters. Names has its own first_name of Ron and last_name of Weasley. These variables only belong to this instance = these variables are instance variables.</p>
