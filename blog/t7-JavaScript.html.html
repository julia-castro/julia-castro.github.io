  <h1>Javascript Objects vs. Ruby Hashes</h1>
  <h4>4.14.15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>As I've been learning Javascript, I'm realizing that I'm having an easier time of it because I already have a foundation in Ruby. The two languages share a lot of the same concepts, but differ only in syntax (which admittedly, does mess me up quite a bit).</p>

    <p>One very blatant similarity between the two languages are Javascript Objects and Ruby Hashes.</p>

    <p>Javascript objects are data structures compised of different properties. They are declared as variables, and like Ruby hashes, are a way of organizing key/value pairs. The example below demonstrates how objects are created using the literal technique.</p>

    var me = { <br>
      name: "Julia", <br>
      age: 24 <br>
  } <br>
<br>
    <p>The object "me" has two properties. To access each property:</p>

    console.log(me.name)<br>
    console.log(me.age)<br>
<br>
    <p>You can delete a property by writing delete me.name<br>
    To declare a new property, write me.gender = "female"</p>

    <p>Ruby hashes look extremely similar. Values are assigned to keys using =></p>

    me = { "name" => "Julia",<br>
    "age" => 24 <br>
  }<br>
  <br>
    <p>You can access values in a hash just like an array.</p>

    puts me["name"]<br>
<br>
    <p>You can delete a key-value pair by writing me.delete("name")<br>
    To add a new key-value pair write me["gender"] = "female"</p>
