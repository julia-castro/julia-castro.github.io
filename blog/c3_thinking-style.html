  <h1>MIND STYLES</h1>
  <h2>How does my mind work? No idea!</h2>
  <h4>3.15.15</h4>

  <p>After <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">taking the personal thinking style test,</a> I found out that I am a Concrete Sequential Thinker and an Abstract Random Thinker.</p>
  <p>Although I think this is accurate, I was a bit surprised because the two styles seem to oppose each other. Concrete Sequential Thinkers like order and directions, learn best in structured environments and struggle when working in groups. Abstract Random Thinkers bring harmony to group situations, establish healthy relationships with others, learn best in a personalized environment and struggle when havin to explain or justify feelings. </p>
  <p>After thinking more about it, I think I am a Concrete Sequential Thinker in my work life and an Abstract Random Thinker in my personal life</p>
  <p>In relation to my experiences so far in Phase 0 DBC, I have been struggling to get things done in a timely manner. It's either I don't time block and spend way too much time on a challenge or I procrastinate. Either way I am rushing to get things done. I think this relates to my being a Concrete Sequential Thinker. Because Phase 0 is a remote program, I am having a difficult time without structure. I feel like I'll do much better on-site. In the meantime, I think the best plan of action is to create a strict schedule for myself for literally every hour of the day.</p>
  <p>Even though I don't love working in groups, one way I can grow is to peer-pair more than the required amount. I have to admit that I often dread my peer pairing sessions in the time leading up to them, but once I'm in it, I enjoy getting to know the other person. This will also help me stay on track with scheduling and create structure for myself because I have to be ready to peer pair at a set time. </p>
