  <h1>Positioning</h1>
  <h2>and not pulling my hair out</h2>

      One of the best ways to learn something is to try to teach it to someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
       As I’m struggling to build my very first web page, as basic it is, I find that positioning is making me want to pull my hair out. The CSS position property is one way to position HTML elements on a webpage. It allows you to create something as simple as a three-column layout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position property takes 5 values: static, relative, absolute, fixed and inherit. I’ll go over inherit another time, as I am still trying to wrap my head around the first four.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ll start with static and fixed - the easiest of the four.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don’t specify a HTML element’s position, it automatically defaults to the static position. In other words, it goes where it would normally go without you doing anything. Currently this is my favorite position as it requires me to do absolutely nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fixed position basically glues the HTML element to the screen. Even if you scroll up and down on a page, the fixed element stays put.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:<br>
      div {<br>
        position:fixed;<br>
        top:20px;<br>
        left:10px;<br>
    }<br>
    In this case the div would stay 20px from the top of your browser window and 10px from the left AT ALL TIMES. The fixed positioning anchors this element to the browser window.
  </p>
  <p>
    Relative positioning is also pretty straightforward. An element that has relative positioning moves relative to where it would have landed if it just had static positioning.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example:<br>
    div { <br>
      position:relative; <br>
      top:20px;<br>
      left:10px;<br>
  }<br>
  Your div will be 20px down from the top and 10px left of where it otherwise would have been.
</p>
<p>
  I think absolute positioning is easy to understand but difficult to implement. I find myself repeating its definition while trying to get my HTML elements where I want them. An element that is set to absolute position is positioned relative to the first parent element that doesn’t have the position static. If all other elements are set to static, then the element gets positioned relative to the html, or to the webpage.
</p>
<p>
  For example:<br>
    #my div { <br>
      position:absolute; <br>
      margin-left:20px; <br>
  } <br>
   #your div { <br>
      position:absolute; <br>
 }
 <p>
  <p>In this case, #my div will be positioned relative to #your div because #your div has the absolute position. In other words, #my div will move 20px right of #your div’s left margin. BUT if #your div was static, then #my div would be moved relative to the entire HTML document.
