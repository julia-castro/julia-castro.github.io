  <h1>DBC: Kitchen VS. Table</h1>
  <h2>I was at the table</h2>

      Based on the video, my take on the DBC experience is that it is similar to college in that learning and education take precedence, but unique in that it redefines the teacher-student relationship. Like Shareef mentioned, students are “quiet” in a traditional learning environment. We are taught to listen intently to our teachers, while they lecture and fill our heads with knowledge. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with this teacher-student relationship, and I actually think it’s quite effective, as I’m a product of it and am proud of my education. But I also think that there is something to be said for what DBC proposes. DBC redefines the student-teacher relationship; in the DBC environment, the teacher-student relationship only exists in that there are people who are deemed “teachers” and people who are deemed “students,” but that is it. The roles and responsibilities of “teacher” and “student” are shared by both groups. Since I’m not on campus yet, I’m not 100% sure that this is accurate, but it seems evident in enough even in Phase 0. All that being said, I’m excited for DBC. I think it will be a place of immense growth, creativity and self-reflection.

       One thing that Shareef said that really stuck with me is his metaphor of “table” and “kitchen.” He proposes that there are two types of experiences, exemplified by what goes on in a restaurant. The customers at a restaurant are at the “table”; they are owed their dining experience because they paid for it. The entire experience is a product and a service that they are entitled to simply because they sat down and handed over their card. On the other hand, the people in the kitchen are all working together and feel a responsibility of and ownership of the dining experience. They are creating the experience for others and for themselves.

       I think that the way to succeed at DBC, both personally and professionally, is to be the people that are in the “kitchen.” Shareef asks that we not see DBC as a product that we are owed because we paid tuition, but rather as an experience that we are creating for ourselves.
