  <h1>Sterotype Threat</h1>
  <h4>4.5.15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>As a woman, I definitely feel "imposter syndrome" or "stereotype threat" in this industry. This is a great source of conflict for me because part of the reason I decided to learn to code was because I finally realized that this is something that I was capable of doing. I grew up learning and loving literature, philosophy, humanities etc...but with that came the belief that I just wasn't smart enough for STEM studies. I would be remiss if I said that part of that wasn't related to gender. I think a lot of girls grow up thinking that STEM is for boys. Now that I'm older I know that this is not true, and yet I constantly feel imposter syndrome. This has manifested in increased distraction and anxiety.
