    One thing about myself that I'm very proud of is my ability to ask questions and admit when I don't understand something. As proof, a lot of my anonymous feedback from my DBC cohort-mates includes a comment kindly noting my tendency to do so. Throughout my life I have learned that it is way better to ask questions when you don't understand than keep quiet and fall behind. I also think that is a very humbling thing to ask questions and it allows others to be comfortable around you.

    In my last peer-pairing session I asked my peer-pair to elaborate on the ruby inject method. Instead of just saying "I don't understand the inject method," I explained what I did understand in the specific instance - that it summed up the integers in an array - but I asked how it did that/ what was going on behind the scenes. This way, my peer-pair could see exactly where I had confusion.
