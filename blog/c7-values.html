    <h6>Release 1: Exploring Your Values</h6>
    <p>When I think of the times in my life where I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the following values come to mind. In general, I try to live up to these values (on a scale of 1-5, 1 being Disagree and 5 Agree.)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accomplishment 4</li>
      <li>Achievment 4</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Since I graduated college in 2013, the value meaningful work has become very important to me. Growing up, I had the privilege of only having to do and study what was meaningful to me: reading, writing, English literature. After graduation, I had to support myself by taking jobs in which I was very unhappy. I was unhappy because the work was not meaningful to me in any way, and was only a means to pay my rent. Now I am lucky enough to find meaningful work again through DevBootcamp.</p>

    <p>The last topic that someone asked for my advice on was related to decisiveness, adventure and location. A friend of mine who went to college in our hometown felt conflicted about the next step in her life. Should she make the practical and secure choice of staying in our hometown or she should she move to another city even if she had to start her life all over?</p>

    <p>When I think it about my values it reminds me of times in my life where I very much felt all those things. I think it will help me mediate stereotype threat because it will serve as a reminder of what I'm working towards.</p>
