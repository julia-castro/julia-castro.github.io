  <h1>OO vs. Functional Programming</h1>
  <h4>4.5.15</h4>

  <section>

    <p>In my short time programming I have only been exposed to object-oriented programming in my attempts to learn Ruby. I've learned that everything is an object, and that these objects interact with eachother using methods. Objects also have attributes, which are just data.</p>

    For example, in<br>
<br>
    "Julia".length<br>
    # ==> 5<br>

    <p>the "Julia" object is a string with a .length method and a length attribute of 4.</p>

    <p>Object-oriented programming seems to be based on a simple concept, but in researching object-oriented programming vs. functional programming I've learned there is more to it.</p>

    <p>As the term suggests, object-oriented programming emphasizes objects and so we define these objects in terms of data that they encapsulate and hide from the outside world and the behaviour that the objects expose to the outside world, which operates on that data.</p>

  <p>Here's an example of a rectangle class. It has hidden data, width and height, and doesn't expose those anywhere to the outside world. But you can ask it things, like are you a square? or you if you want it to be a square, you can mutate it into a square.</p>

  class Rectangle<br>
  def initialize(width, height)<br>
    @width = width<br>
    @height = height<br>
  end<br>
<br>
  def square?<br>
    @width == @height<br>
  end<br>
<br>
  def square!<br>
    if @width > @height<br>
    @height = @width<br>
    else<br>
    @width = @height<br>
    end<br>
  end<br>
end<br>
<br>

<p>Functional Programming emphasizes functions. Instead of data encapsulation,it has you define very simple public data structures.</p>

<p>Here we have a rectangle structure, which has width and height, which are publicly accessible everywhere. You then define functions which accept those data structures and then return data structures as a result. The square! method accepts a rectangle, but instead of modifying it, it returns a new rectangle.</p>

Rectangle = Struct.new(:width, :height)<br>
<br>
def square?(rectangle)<br>
  rectangle.width == rectangle.height<br>
end<br>
<br>
def square!(rectangle)<br>
  if rectangle.width > rectangle.height<br>
    Rectangle.new(rectangle.width, rectangle.width)<br>
  else<br>
    Rectangle.new(rectangle.height,rectangle.height)<br>
  end<br>
end
