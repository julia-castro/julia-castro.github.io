  <h1>Issues in Tech</h1>
  <h4>3.129.15</h4>
  <p>At Google, women hold onl 17% of the company's tech jobs. At Facebook, 15% of tech roles are staffed by women. At Twitter it's 10% (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html">Huffington Post</a>).</p>
  <p>I think the problem is clear here. There has been lots of talk recently about how women are leaving the tech industry in droves (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-women-tech-20150222-story.html#page=1">Los Angeles Times</a>). At first I was suprised - there are now plenty of programs that encourage girls' interest in technology - but I shouldn't have been, of course, sexism and stereoyptes still prevail.

  <p>Whenever advice is given to women who work in a male-dominated industry is given, you are bound to hear something along the lines of "hard work excuses anything". Yes, of course, there is truth in that. But I think the problem is that once women do prove themselves, they are then asked again to prove themselves over and over again because they are women.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, stereotypes and misogynistic tendences are systematically embedded in society. They are created without us even knowing. Because of this I don't think there is an easy solution: it is not something that can be fixed over a short period of time.</p>
