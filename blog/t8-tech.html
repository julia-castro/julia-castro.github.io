<p>Rails is a framework for building web applications.</p>

<p>Before I started DBC, I had heard the terms “Ruby”, “Ruby on Rails” and “Rails” both simultaneously and interchangeably without really knowing if they were the same thing, if they were two different things, or what they were at all. I knew Ruby was a “language” and Rails was a “framework”, but I didn’t really know what that meant either.</p>

<p>Now that I’m a few weeks in at DBC, I am acquainted with Ruby, but still don’t really know how it works with Rails or what Rails even is. From my quick research, this is what I think I understand.</p>

<p>Ruby is a programming language that is extended by Rails, which is a software library. It is a framework that establishes conventions for easier collaboration and maintenance. In other words, it gives you shortcuts to help you use Ruby to make web applications.</p>

<p>For example, with Rails you only ONE LINE of code to make a link! That’s how easy it is.</p>
