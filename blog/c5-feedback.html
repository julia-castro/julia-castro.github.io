  <h1>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h1>
  <h4>3.29.15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>My favorite part of Phase 0 is pairing with others. I always get nervous before a pairing sessions, mostly because of insecurity and self-doubt, but I always end up LOVING pairing with people. I think it is when I learn the most and feel most accomplished. Because of this, I am so excited to get on-site and I think that is when I'll do well. I love working with people and being around people so Phase 0 has been difficult for me. The only frustrating part of peer-pairing is the fact that I get frustrated sometimes and can't hide it. When you're alone and you get frustrated, it's kinda ok. But when you're working with someone else, you have to continue to put a smile on in order to keep going.

    <p>I enjoyed reading my feedback. It made me feel better about where I am in the program because I am quick to lose my confidence while I am learning. It was encouraging to read what other people had to say. There was one piece of feedback in particular that gave me "tough-love". That is the feedback that is stuck in my mind. The person said I have to commit to the program more time wise. I really feel this is a wake up call.
