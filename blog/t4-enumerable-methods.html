   <h5>Enumerable#map</h5>
   <p>The Map method is actually very simple and is used to transform an array without altering the original. It takes an array and a block of code and returns a new array by running the block of code for every element in the array.Simply put, it transforms your original array into a new set of values.
  </p>
  <p>For example: </br>
    [1,2,3,4].map{|x| x + 1}</br>
    =>[2,3,4,5]</br>
  </br>
  ["a","b","c"].map{|x| x.upcase}</br>
  =>{"A","B","C"}
  </p>
